# About
My name is Liam Atkinson and I am an undergraduate student at The University of Queensland. Specifically, I am undergoing the integrated Bachelor (Hons.) and Masters of Engineering degree, majoring in Electrical Engineering. As a part of my studies in ELEC4630, I have started using fastai and through the use of this blog my findings and journey will be documented and published.
