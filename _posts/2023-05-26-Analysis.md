# Classification Performance Analsys with FastAI

With the dataset refined and trained, the image classification performance can be tested. This can be done through a range of metrics, including:

- t-SNE
- Confusion Matrix

To provide an easier solution, an [scikit library](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.manifold.TSNE.html) is used to provide the t-SNE performance. 

## t-SNE:

- Converts similarities between data points to joint probabilities (likelihood that samples choose to be next to each other). 
- Specifically, this works by reducing the dimensionality of data and hence reducing a certain number of characterisation aspects but still retaining a small number of features to allow the classification.

## Confusion Matrix:

- Perhaps more intuitive, the confusion matrix is a table that illustrates the performance of the classification system.
- Displays the highest probably class of an image against the actual class of the image. 

<img src="/images/a6.png" 
     width="400" />

As seen from the image above, by considering the columns, the number of correctly and incorrectly classified images can be determined. This directly correlates with the previously seen accuracy from fine-tuning but provides information more specifically on which classifications may have been less or more effective. 


Thus, these techniques are useful in evaluating the performance of the system.
